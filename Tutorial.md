# HOW TO LAUNCH A PROJECT ON POLKADOT 


# Introduction

Polkadot is a fast-growing ecosystem that enables cross-chain communication within its parachains. This interoperability and scalability will take blockchain technology to a new level. It will solve a number of current problems such as high transition fees, hard forks and low TPS.

In this tutorial I will explain how to develop and launch your dApp project on Polkadot.
